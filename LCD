I2C stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit. It is a one wire communication protocol which uses single data line to transfer the Data Bits from Master to Slave device.

Connection of I2C LCD with Arduino

Arduino Uno	            I2C LCD
+5v                     VCC
GND                     GND
A4                      SDA
A5                      SCL

After circuit cnnection, install the "LiquidCrystal I2C" from library manager, run the I2C scanner program to find out the address of I2C module attached with LCD.


#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27,16,2);  // set the LCD address to ---- for a 16 chars and 2 line display after running I2C scanner program here

void setup() {
  lcd.init();
  lcd.clear();         
  lcd.backlight();      // Make sure backlight is on
  
  // Print a message on both lines of the LCD.
  lcd.setCursor(2,0);   //Set cursor to character 2 on line 0
  lcd.print("Hello world!");
  
  lcd.setCursor(2,1);   //Move cursor to character 2 on line 1
  lcd.print("LCD Tutorial");
}

void loop() {
}
